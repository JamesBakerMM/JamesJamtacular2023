            <h1>Welcome to MantleWorks Management</h1>
            <p>Hello Valued Franchisee! Thank you for joining the MantleWorks Family, you've been assigned your mining fleet, and your first asteroid belt! Be sure to clear it quickly for a pay bonus!</p>
            <p>You'll start by controlling the refinery, which has autonomous drones:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><TH>Ship:</TH><th>Refinery</th><TH>Drone</TH></tr>
                <tr><th>Image:</th>
                    <td><img src="assets/img/fac0_refinery.png" alt="The refinery"></td>
                    <td><img src="assets/img/fac0_drone.png" alt="A drone"></td></tr>
                <tr><th>Selection key:</th><td>1</td><td>Autonomous</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>You'll need to move the refinery so the drones can collect metal 
                from asteroids and wreckages.</p>
            <p>You can select controllable ships by:</p>
            <UL>
                <LI>clicking and dragging, to select all controllable ships in an area; or</LI>
                <Li>using a selection key, to select all ships of a particular type.</Li>
            </UL>
            <p>Then right-click where you'd like them to go -- 
                either on the main screen or on your minimap.</p>
            <p>You can press 'D' to deselect everything.</p>
            <p>The minimap will show you where it detects 
                <span id="asteroid">asteroids</span> or
                <span id="wreckage">wreckages</span>. 
                As you travel, your sensors will reveal more details.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr><TH>Resource:</TH><th>Asteroid</th><TH>Wreckage</TH></tr>
                <tr><TH>Image:</TH><td><img src="assets/img/rock_asteroid1.png" alt="Asteroid"></td>
                    <td><img src="assets/img/wreckage1.png" alt="Wreckage"></td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>The refinery crew will be able to analyse the technology in the wreckage,
                which will let you unlock new types of ships for your fleet:
            </p>
            <table><TR><TH>Ship:</TH><TH>Gunship</TH><TH>Torpedo ship</TH><TH>Laser fighter</TH></TR>
                <TR><TH>Image:</TH><TD><img src="assets/img/fac0_gunship.png" alt="Gunship"></TD>
                    <TD><img src="assets/img/fac0_torpedo.png" alt="Torpedo ship"></TD>
                    <td><img src="assets/img/fac0_laser.png" alt="Laser fighter"></td>
                </TR>
                <TR><TH>Selection key:</TH><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
            </table>
            <p>But I'm sure you won't need those for anything.</p>
